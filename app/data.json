  "about": [
    "I'm a recent Computer Science grad. I began coding with Python in 2020, explored web development with JavaScript, and was fascinated by Linux and cloud things in my fourth semester. It opened my eyes to how apps are deployed and maintained on a large scale.",
    "I also have a solid understanding of different programming languages like Python, C++, and JavaScript. These skills, combined with my problem-solving mindset, have helped me tackle 400+ LeetCode problems, providing a different perspective to approach challenges",
    "I  started using Linux in January 2022; it's almost 2 years now, and I absolutely love everything about Linux. I began with Vim and moved to Neovim, and my dotfiles repository has grown a lot since then. Additionally, I love dark color schemes and gradient texts; you can see them in all my works.",
    "I 'm currently looking for job opportunities. This year has been full of unexpected changes, but I'm hopeful that it will lead to a job offer for me."
